### Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I am an AI (Authentic Intelligence) machine, passionate about my children, sports and technology. After over 8 years in Public Service, working with legal matters and office management, I leaped into a new career, country and hemisphere.

I traded the suit and briefcase to a nice computer and some cool technologies, to follow an old dream and be part of the exciting world of tech, as Iâ€™m working to sharp my web development skills since 2021.

I am really good at:

â€¢ JavaScript â€¢ TypeScript â€¢ C# â€¢ .NET â€¢ ReactJS / React Native â€¢ NodeJS â€¢ MySQL â€¢ Git â€¢ JSON â€¢ RESTful APIs
